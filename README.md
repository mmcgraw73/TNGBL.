# TNGs.

#### what is TNGs?

please know this is a WIP in the EARLY stages - im aware its buggy as a georgia swamp in august

_TNGs/tangibles/a thing that is perceptible by touch._

a vanilla JavaScript MVC application created for collectors that aims to make categorizing and documenting your collection as easy as possible.

#### why do i need TNGs?

- allows you to quickly define object models for your collectible with as many/few properties as you'd like
- export/save spreadsheet/csv to Google Cloud [Google Docs API](https://developers.google.com/docs/api)
- create an anonomous album to showcase and share a collection using [IMGUR's](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#intro) API
- creates a `reactive` local storage database in the form of a JSON object

#### other features / road map

SHORT TERM:

- IMGUR Integration - free API ~hosting files on IMGUR ~local storage to build page

LONG TERM:

- UPC barcode scanner - requires smartphone
- item search w/in app w/ google search engine
- IMGUR Integration

- i want an application that will let me define a json object defining attributes of a type of 'tangible' collectible. ie. silkscreen posters, comic books, LOTR collection of POP vinyls and first editions. using only that json object build and serve a webpage that showcases the user collection in a fully custimizable SPA with CRUD functionality on demand
